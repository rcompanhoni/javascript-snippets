# Merged String Checker

Write an algorithm to check if a given string, *s*, can be formed from two other strings, *part1* and *part2*.

The restriction is that the characters in *part1* and *part2* are in the same order as in *s*.

```
    'codewars' is a merge from 'cdw' and 'oears':

    s:  c o d e w a r s   = codewars
    part1:  c   d   w         = cdw
    part2:    o   e   a r s   = oears
```
